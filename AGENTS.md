# Agent Guidelines

## Current implementation
- FastAPI `/chat` endpoint handles the static sanity checks ("ping", base key echo, member key echo) before delegating to the agent.
- A Pydantic-AI agent instrumented with Logfire resolves catalogue lookups through PostgreSQL fuzzy search and feature extraction tools.
- The data layer assumes PostgreSQL connection details are provided via the environment variables listed in `.env.template`.

## Ground rules for new changes
- Keep solutions simple, well-documented, and strongly typed; prefer the minimal implementation that satisfies the competition scenarios without per-scenario branching (scenario 0 may remain hard-coded).
- Use `uv` for dependency management, FastAPI for the HTTP layer, and Pydantic-AI for agent workflows. Avoid introducing conflicting or deprecated libraries.
- When modifying agent behaviour, express shared heuristics in tool descriptions or the system prompt rather than hard-coding logic paths per scenario.
- Run `uv run pytest` (and any other affected checks) before completing a task to keep the test suite passing.
- Update this file whenever project rules or capabilities change so future tasks inherit accurate guidance.
